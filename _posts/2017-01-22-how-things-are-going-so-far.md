**Hello again!** Now that I’ve told you a little bit about my history and why I am on the path I am on, let me tell you how things are going so far.


I’ve made a few projects:
* A music app
* A discussion app
* A chat app
* An address book app

I am also currently working on an app that lets users create and share wikis. I’ll go into more detail about each of these projects when I do case studies on them, so look for those soon.


I am learning *a ton* from these projects, but I still have plenty to learn. I expect to come back to my projects to improve them as I continue to learn. My experience of web development so far has taught me that it is a field where you constantly learn and *it is impossible to know everything.* This is great because constantly learning was one aspect I loved about teaching, but it certainly does make it harder to be a beginner because there is so much to learn to even create the most basic applications.


So, I’ve decided *not to worry too much about everything I don’t know* — instead, I’m focusing on *learning how to approach problems, what steps to take, and where and how to look for help.* Even when I’m farther down this path, I think these will be skills I will need, so I am working on developing them now.
