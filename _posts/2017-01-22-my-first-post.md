**Hello there!** My name is Kate Adams. I am a former teacher and aspiring software developer. Why am I making the transition, you ask? Well, let me tell you.


**I loved my students** — their energy, curiosity, and humor. I enjoyed learning from them every day while watching them learn and grow. I felt honored when I gained their trust and they turned to me for help and support. When they conquered a struggle or were resilient in the face of difficulties, I was inspired. I miss them all the time and how unpredictable life in the classroom with them was.


But educators and students do not exist in a classroom bubble, and they shouldn’t. They exist in the context of schools, administrators, and disciplinary policies, along with so many other factors. Some of these, even with the best intentions of the people behind them, make it very difficult to be a happy and successful teacher these days. Unfortunately, I felt like some of these factors were preventing me from *being the teacher I wanted to be,* the teacher who did the most she could to help her students thrive, and, in the process, were crushing my optimism, hope, and values. So I decided to step outside the classroom.


I spent a lot of time reflecting on what I liked and what skills I had. I thought of my love of puzzles, language, learning, creating, editing, and thoughtful design, among other things. Last year, while working in higher education, I started exploring coding with free online resources. I was amazed to see how engaging I found it. I quickly saw the connections between coding, the tasks I enjoy, and the skills I have, so I continued learning. This past summer, I decided to commit to learning to code and giving myself a chance to have a new career by enrolling in a software development course online.


Ideally, I would love to have a career in EdTech, so that I could blend my belief in the importance of education and learning with my passion for coding and building applications and websites. I hope that I will be able to work on tools I used as a teacher, help others learn through education platforms, or work on creating or modifying new tools that *help educators in the difficult and important work they do.* But, I am still at the beginning of this new chapter, so we will see where my path takes me. I hope you stick around to find out with me!
