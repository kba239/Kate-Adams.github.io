# Blocipedia
Do you want to create and collaborate on wikis? [Blocipedia](https://github.com/kba239/blocipedia) is a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to create accounts, write and edit wikis, and collaborate on wikis with other users.

Blocipedia is a Ruby on Rails application I created as part of my Bloc software development program.

### Features
* Users can create and update their accounts to be standard or premium.
* Users pay for premium accounts, which allow them to create and view private wikis.
* If users upgrade their accounts, they automatically have the option to make their wikis private.
* If users downgrade their accounts, their wikis automatically become public.


This was one of my earlier Ruby on Rails projects, so I learned a lot from it. I used Devise for user authentication, Redcarpet for wiki Markdown formatting, Pundit for authorization, and Stripe for premium account payments. This project gave me great problem-solving experience and gave me experience implementing some important features.
