# Blocitoff
Have you ever found it hard to keep your to-do list up-to-date? Does your list often seem full of tasks that are no longer relevant? [Blocitoff](https://github.com/kba239/blocitoff) automatically moves tasks out of your active task list after 7 days, so that it is easier to keep your list current.


Blocitoff is an application I created with JavaScript, Angular, and Firebase as part of my Bloc software development program. Users can create a free account, sign in, and create tasks for their to-do list. When creating a task, users can mark the level of importance; users can also mark tasks as completed. If an expired or previous marked as complete task is not complete, users can view their past tasks and change the task status to active.

Since I had complete a couple of JavaScript and Angular projects before this project, I had a better understanding of how to go about this project and ran into fewer challenges. I did have trouble getting the active and past tasks to show once I added the separate categories. After I went back through carefully and made sure that the naming of tasks, especially tasks vs. task, were consistent, the two lists showed successfully. It was a good reminder of the importance of an attention to detail and of how tiny differences matter.
