short-description: Create your to-do list on Blocitoff!

# Blocitoff
Have you ever found it hard to keep your to-do list up-to-date? Does your list often seem full of tasks that are no longer relevant? [Blocitoff](https://github.com/kba239/blocitoff) automatically moves tasks out of your active task list after 7 days so that it is easier to keep your list current.

Blocitoff is an application I created with JavaScript, Angular, and Firebase as part of my Bloc software development program. Users can create free accounts, sign in, and create tasks for their to-do lists. When creating tasks, users can mark the levels of importance; users can also mark tasks as completed. If an expired or previously marked as complete task is not complete, users can view their past tasks and change the status of a task to active.

Since I had completed a couple JavaScript and Angular projects before this project, I had a better understanding of how to go about this project and ran into fewer challenges. I had to learn how to get the date of a task and see if the task was seven days old or older. I had some trouble getting the active and past tasks to appear once I added the separate categories. After I went back through my work carefully and made sure that the naming of tasks, especially "tasks" vs. "task," were consistent, the two lists displayed successfully. It was a good reminder of the importance of attention to detail and of how tiny differences matter.
