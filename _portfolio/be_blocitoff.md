# Blocitoff
Have you ever found it hard to keep your to-do list up-to-date? Does your list often seem full of tasks that are no longer relevant? [Blocitoff](https://github.com/kba239/bEBlocitoff) automatically moves tasks out of your active task list after 7 days, so that it is easier to keep your list current.


Blocitoff is a Ruby on Rails application I created as part of my Bloc software development program. Users can create a free account, sign in, and create tasks for their to-do list. I used Devise for user accounts, Bootstrap for style, Faker for seeding data, and displaying the time until expiration. I had previous created a JavaScript and Angular version of Blocitoff, so it was interesting to approach the same idea with Ruby on Rails.


Since I had complete a couple of Ruby on Rails projects before this project, I had a better understanding of how to go about this project and ran into fewer challenges. I did have trouble getting the checkmarks for marking a task as complete to show. I had forgotten to rename the style sheet file as a Bootstrap file after installing Bootstrap, so Bootstrap wasn't working. It was a good reminder of the importance of an attention to detail and of going step by step when making changes. I am gaining confidence in implementing features and problem-solving. I look forward to my next Ruby on Rails project!
