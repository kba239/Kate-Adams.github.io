short-description: Create your to-do list on Blocitoff!

# Blocitoff
Have you ever found it hard to keep your to-do list up-to-date? Does your list often seem full of tasks that are no longer relevant? [Blocitoff](https://github.com/kba239/bEBlocitoff) automatically moves tasks out of your active task list after 7 days so that it is easier to keep your list current.

Blocitoff is a Ruby on Rails application I created as part of my Bloc software development program. Users can create free accounts, sign in, and create tasks for their to-do lists. I used Devise for user accounts, Bootstrap for style, and Faker for seeding data. I had previously created a JavaScript and Angular version of Blocitoff, so it was interesting to approach the same idea with Ruby on Rails.

Since I had completed a couple Ruby on Rails projects before this project, I had a better understanding of how to go about this project and ran into fewer challenges. I did have trouble getting the checkmarks for marking a task as complete to appear because I had forgotten to rename the style sheet file as a Sass file. It was a good reminder of the importance of attention to detail and of going step by step when making changes. I am gaining confidence in implementing features and problem-solving. I look forward to my next Ruby on Rails project!
